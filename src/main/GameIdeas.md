# Born with the Stars - Game Design Document

## 1. Core Concept
A 2D top-down exploration and survival game where the player navigates a world of islands and oceans.

## 2. Gameplay Mechanics
### Current Features
- **Movement**: WASD with diagonal normalization and "banking" visual effect.
- **Interaction**: Inventory system, item selection, and basic object interaction.
- **World**: Tile-based map with distinct biomes (Deep Ocean, Coastline, Ground).
- **System**: Save/Load functionality and Zoom support.
- **Ideas**: Think Zelda (you grow up, from a kid to an adult), Pokemon (you work other entities to defeat enemies and level them up), Final Fantasy (turn-based strategy that includes physical weapons and magical ones), Stardew Valley (at times peaceful life sim)

### Planned Features
- **Crafting System**: Combine items to create tools or potions.
- **Combat**: Simple melee attacks (Sword) and projectile logic.
- **Sailing**: Specific mechanics for traversing the "Deep Ocean" tiles faster.
- **Day/Night Cycle**: Visual overlay affecting visibility and mob spawning.

## 3. Story & Setting
- **Theme**: Celestial/Nautical survival.
- **Plot**: The protagonist must navigate by the stars to explore the archipelago.

## 4. Technical Roadmap
- [ ] Implement `SoundManager` for BGM and SFX.
- [ ] Add enemy entities and basic AI.
- [ ] Expand map generation (or improve the DevMode map generator).
- [ ] Enhance UI (Visual Health bar, drag-and-drop inventory).

## 5. Brainstorming / Notes
- *option to start as a baby, adolescent, or adult? like if you have played in kid mode before and didn't like it*
- *it is safe at camp, where you start; but when you leave you start experiencing monsters and the need to battle*
- *monsters should be real animals, but also some mythical ones... without magic we might lose sight of how cool the connection with nature really was*
- *with the "spirit" concept, there should be an idea of give and take in this game. ultimately, finding balance with nature is how we live happy.*
